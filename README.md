## Usage 
            
Open your terminal and navigate to the folder that you are holding the index.js file for this project in. Before running node, you will have to install axios, and inquirer. After you have installed these tools or if you already had them installed globally on your computer, run the command "node. index.js". Type out everything you would like included into your README and select appropriate license. Once you have finished answering all of the questions your README.md file will be written and stored in the same folder as the index.js file.
